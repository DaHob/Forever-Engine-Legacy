name: Object Null Refrence Crash
about: I have been told to go to this page. It is an actual problem with the files, and I cannot play my fnf mod. The forever engine seems to crash because of an "Object Null Refrence" and it happened around 22:35 on UK time.  I tried playing the first song of the mod and then it crashed. I'm not sure if its just me, or others have experienced this crashed with the engine. It has the follwing error(s):
meta/state/PlayState.hx (line 2313)
flixel/FlxState.hx (line 203)
flixel/FlxGame.hx (line 747)
flixel/FlxGame.hx (line 677)
flixel/FlxGame.hx (line 551)
openfl/events/EventDispatcher.hx (line 402)
openfl/display/DisplayObject.hx (line 1399)

The text above is what was displayed. I would like to get a fix today or tomorrow, at around 4:00 UK time. I am very confused and cannot figure what is going on.
Please help I don't know where else to go if this bug report gets shut down
